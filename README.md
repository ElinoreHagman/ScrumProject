# ScrumProject
 Group project VT2020

An information system for Ã–rebro University where teachers can share pictures, files and discuss topics related to their work or private lives. There is a notification system in place where teachers get an email whenever someone posts something in a category they've chosen to get notifications on. The teachers can also book meetings and they show up as a public calendar on the website.

# Regarding the code
This project was focused on the techniques Scrum and Extreme programming within the group of 8 students, and not so much the actual project. Therefore there are quite a bit of unfinished/nonexistent functions, not optimal techniques and lacking design etc.

# Things to fix/correct
*Coorect validation for all inputs (phone number have almost none)*\
*Move the section where you write a new post to respective wall instead of having it on a own detached page.*\
*Add so you can have a profile picture and a introduction text on your own profile page.*\
*Make all teachers' names (ex. in the calendar and blog posts) clickable and linked to their own profile page.*\
*Replace the calendar with a more interactive calendar.*
